# Requirements

To use **Laravel Reports**, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **PHP**: Version 8.1 or higher.
- **Laravel**: Version 10.0, 11.0, or 12.0.
- **Dependencies**:
    - `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf`: ^3.1
    - `spatie/laravel-package-tools`: ^1.16

This library functions as a robust container over `laravel-dompdf`, so it inherits its system dependencies (such as the PHP extensions required for PDF handling).
